/// @brief This file exposes the API for keeping statistics in the provided data-structures.
/// The provided statistics are the total number of atomic instructions, the amount of each 
/// type of atomic instructions, atomic instructions per operation, etc.
/// Notice that this API should be used only by Posix threads. In the case where there more 
/// than one fiber per Posix thread, only a single fiber thread should use this API.
/// In case that the API of threadtools.h is used, most the provided functionality 
/// (except synchPrintStats function), should not be directely used by the user.

/// threads threads have called the synchStopCPUCounters function. A good place for calling this function is to place as a last
/// instruction just before the return of main function (examples of usage could be found in almost all the provided benchmarks
/// under the benchmarks directory.).
/// @param nthreads The total number of threads that have executed concurrent operations.
/// @param runs The total number of the executed operations. Notice that benchmarks for stacks and queues
/// execute SYNCH_RUNS pairs of operations (i.e. pairs of push/pops or pairs of enqueues/dequeues).
