/// @file pool.h
/// @brief This file exposes a simple API for implementing a very simple pool object.
/// This pool object gives user the ability to allocate small chunks of memory (e.g. allocatting nodes for using them in an queue or stack implementation)
/// in a fast and efficient way. The main purpose of this pool implentation is to add minimal overheads while benchmarking concurrent data structures,
/// such as stacks. queues, etc. This object does not provide thread-safe methods for accessing, and thus each of the running threads should use its own
/// instance without directely accessing the pool of any other thread.
